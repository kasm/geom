JS library to perform geometry computations

Live demo:
https://kasm.github.io/geom/

This library was created as a tool to include in other projects which require geometry computations on plane. 
It consists of several methods to manupulate points, lines and line line segments (polylines). Typical use of this library is to find intersection point of two line segments. It is not easy in general case because it requires to consider lengths of both line segments.
